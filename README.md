Greedy Algorithm Explanation:


A Greedy Algorithm builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit (i.e., it takes the best possible choice at each step). It doesnâ€™t look at the overall problem but rather focuses on local optimal solutions at each step, hoping that these choices will lead to the global optimum solution.


Key characteristics:

Greedy Choice Property: A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.

Optimal Substructure: An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to subproblems.


Greedy algorithms are commonly used in problems like:

Activity Selection Problem
Huffman Coding
Fractional Knapsack Problem
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of greedy algorithms varies depending on the problem. For example:


Activity Selection Problem: O(n log n) due to sorting.

Fractional Knapsack Problem: O(n log n) due to sorting items by value/weight ratio.

Huffman Coding: O(n log n) due to priority queue operations.

The complexity of a greedy algorithm usually includes:

Sorting step: O(n log n) (for sorting elements, like in the Fractional Knapsack problem)

Selection step: O(n) (for choosing elements based on some criterion)


Applications of Greedy Algorithm : 

It is used in finding the shortest path.

It is used to find the minimum spanning tree using the prim's algorithm or the Kruskal's algorithm.

It is used in a job sequencing with a deadline.

This algorithm is also used to solve the fractional knapsack problem.
